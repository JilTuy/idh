<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
Geophysicists today use some of the most powerful computers in the world.
This is partly because geophysical data volumes are vast and growing.
Another reason is that raw geophysical data are not easily understood,
and typically require substantial processing and interactive 
visualization and exploration before we can make sense of them.
</p>
<p>
This section of EPICS 251 introduces students of geophysics at Mines 
to the <em>development</em> of computer software for analyzing 
geophysical data. 
We will use freely available tools, such as the programming languages 
Python and Java, and free libraries of software written in these and 
other languages.
We will work in teams, and practice good software engineering.

    We will analyze freely available geophysical data. 
    The image shown here is an example of data available from the 
    <a href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/ngdc.html">
      National Geophysical Data Center
    </a>.
    Can you guess what it is?

Although this section of EPICS 251 is designed for geophysics majors,
others (particularly those with a strong interest in computing) are 
welcome with permission of the instructor.

<h3 class="newpage">Student absences from class, labs, or exams</h3>
All students are advised to be familiar with CSMâ€™s policy regarding 
the make-up of work missed due to excused absences.  
This policy may be found in the Bulletin.  
If a student is ill and exhibits flu-like symptoms, they should not 
attend class, labs, or exams.  
For this particular flu season, the Centers for Disease Control are 
discouraging those who are ill and without serious complications from 
visiting a health clinic or physician thus it will be difficult for 
students to obtain written documentation of their illness for the 
Associate Dean of Students and for faculty. In order for an absence 
based on illness to be excused, the student must normally communicate 
directly with the Associate Dean of Students or his/her instructors.  
To make this notification process easier, particularly in the case of 
students suffering flu-like symptoms, we have created a web-based 
certification system, and strongly encourage students to use this system 
to automatically notify all of their instructors regarding their illness.  
Here is a link to this 
<a href="http://inside.mines.edu/Flu">web-based form.</a>
