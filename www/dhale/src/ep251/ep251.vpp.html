<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
Geophysicists today use some of the most powerful computers in the world.
This is partly because geophysical data volumes are vast and growing.
Another reason is that raw geophysical data are not easily understood,
and typically require substantial processing and interactive 
visualization and exploration before we can make sense of them.
</p>
<p>
This section of EPICS 251 introduces students of geophysics at Mines 
to the <em>development</em> of computer software for analyzing 
geophysical data. 
We will use freely available tools, such as the programming languages 
Python and Java, and free libraries of software written in these and 
other languages.
We will work in teams, and practice good software engineering.

    We will analyze freely available geophysical data. 
    The image shown here is an example of data available from the 
    <a href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/ngdc.html">
      National Geophysical Data Center
    </a>.
    Can you guess what it is?

Although this section of EPICS 251 is designed for geophysics majors,
others (particularly those with a strong interest in computing) are 
welcome with permission of the instructor.

<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>
The computers in GC 297 run Centos 5, a GNU/Linux operating system based
on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.
These systems include open-source software that you can freely download 
and install on your own computers.
All of the software tools used in this course work well on systems running 
GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS X operating systems.
</p>
<p>
  You can download and install <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
  on your computer.
  (If you use Linux or Mac OS X, you already have Python, but may
  want a more recent version. Currently we use version 2.4.)
</p>
<p>
  For scientific computing, we use
  <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy</a> and
  <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>.
  The latter depends on the former.
</p>
<p>
  For 2-D graphics and plotting, we use
  <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">Matplotlib (pylab)</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.jython.org">Jython</a> is 
  <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> for
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase">Java</a> programmers.
