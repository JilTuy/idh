<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
This graduate course was created and is taught with my colleagues in
<a href="http://smartgeo.mines.edu">SmartGeo</a>.
Our students have diverse backgrounds, with degrees in computer science, 
environmental science, civil engineering, geology, or geophysics.
This course provides a common technical foundation, to help them work
in two or more of these disciplines to create intelligent geosystems 
that can sense and adapt to their environments.
</p>
<p>
Following an introduction and overview, the course consists primarily of 
four modules covering sensing, data processing, modeling, and decision 
support. 
The three-week data processing module that I lead is a hands-on
- learn by doing - survey of
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic digital signal processing</li>
  <li>Wiener and time-varying filters</li>
  <li>Interpolation of scattered data</li>
</ul>
<p>
As we analyze, implement and apply various processing methods to 
previously recorded data, we will highlight those methods that might 
best be implemented in real-time in embedded sensors.

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>
Students will work in teams to complete assignments.
Grades for this module are based on your contributions to the
data processing that (1) we all perform in class and (2)
your team performs outside of class.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
While some students in each team will naturally be quicker to 
<em>implement</em> various processing methods, all members of 
each team must <em>understand</em> those methods and be able 
to describe their implementations to others.
</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>
Although I will use freely available open-source software in class,
students may use any computer programming languages and development 
environments in which they are most productive.
Students must have a valid license for any commercial software used.
</p>
<p>
Information on data processing, including complete implementations
of various algorithms, is readily available on the web.
Indeed, you can learn much of the material in this module by 
studying freely available information that you find there.
I encourage you to use such information, just as you would in your 
own research, while <em>acknowledging</em> 
your sources, and <em>understanding</em> 
implementations and limitations in everything that you use.
</p>

<h3>Text (for reference only)</h3>
<p>
<cite>Discrete-Time Signal Processing, 2nd or 3rd Edition</cite>,
by Oppenheim and Schafer.
Purchase of this text is not required for this module.
However, if I could own only one book on digital signal processing, 
this would be the one.
</p>
<p>
The most recent
<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Time-Signal-Processing-Alan-Oppenheim/dp/0131988425">3rd edition</a> 
is now available.
Used copies of the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Time-Signal-Processing-2nd-Prentice-Hall/dp/0137549202">2nd edition</a>
are also available, and two copies of it are on reserve in Arthur Lakes 
Library.

<h3 class="newpage">Student absences from class, labs, or exams</h3>
All students are advised to be familiar with CSMâ€™s policy regarding 
the make-up of work missed due to excused absences.  
This policy may be found in the Bulletin.  
If a student is ill and exhibits flu-like symptoms, they should not 
attend class, labs, or exams.  
For this particular flu season, the Centers for Disease Control are 
discouraging those who are ill and without serious complications from 
visiting a health clinic or physician thus it will be difficult for 
students to obtain written documentation of their illness for the 
Associate Dean of Students and for faculty. In order for an absence 
based on illness to be excused, the student must normally communicate 
directly with the Associate Dean of Students or his/her instructors.  
To make this notification process easier, particularly in the case of 
students suffering flu-like symptoms, we have created a web-based 
certification system, and strongly encourage students to use this system 
to automatically notify all of their instructors regarding their illness.

<a href="http://inside.mines.edu/Flu">web-based form.</a>
