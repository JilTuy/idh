<h3>Painting images in 3D</h3>

Decades ago geophysicists and geologists would use colored pencils to 
paint seismic sections of the earth&apos;s subsurface. 
Those sections were displayed on paper. 
We would use different colors and shades to represent different 
geologic layers. 
Seismic horizons were then simply the boundaries between those colored layers.
</p><p>
So when painting software became widely available with personal computers 
in the 1980s, it was obvious that we might use this software to interpret 
seismic images. 
Digital paint has advantages. 
It can be applied in multiple overlays that we can easily turn off and on, 
and mistakes are easy to undo. 
Moreover, painting geology is simpler and more intuitive and direct than 
picking seismic horizons. 
Painted pixels directly represent a model of the subsurface. 
If we had only 2D seismic sections, we might all be interpreting them 
in this way.
</p><p>
But as painting software became commonplace, so did 3D seismic images, 
and no one wants to paint the hundreds or even thousands of 2D seismic 
sections in a 3D seismic image. 
So today we pick horizons, the interfaces between geologic 
entities, instead of painting geology directly.

<h4>Imagine that we could paint in 3D</h4>

What does this mean? 
It does not mean painting with perspective on a 2D canvas. 
That is what artists do. 
They use perspective and other techniques to give the illusion of 3D. 
We mean something different. 
We want to paint voxels (3D pixels) in a 3D canvas (our subsurface model) 
that coincides with a 3D seismic image.
</p><p>
At the Colorado School of Mines we are blending geophysical image 
processing and interactive computer graphics to paint in 3D. 
The key step is to make the orientation and shape of our digital 3D 
paintbrush conform automatically to features apparent in 3D images. 
Simple 3D brush shapes like spheres or cubes, analogous to circles and 
squares found in 2D painting software, will not do. 
</p><p>
For as we move our paintbrush along slices of a 3D seismic image, we 
are actually painting voxels in a 3D subsurface model of the earth. 
In the example shown here, we are interactively painting all voxels 
inside the red 3D paintbrush.

  <dd><em>
    ... it's shape and size conform automatically to features
    in the 3D image.
  </em></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="img first">
  <dt><img src="images/ImagePaint3C.png" width="320" alt=""/></dt>
  <dd><em>
    We paint all voxels within the 3D paintbrush, not only those 
    voxels in the 2D slices displayed here.
  </em></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="img first">
  <dt><img src="images/ImagePaint3D.png" width="320" alt=""/></dt>
  <dd><em>
    Where no image is available, as on the left side here,
    the default brush shape is spherical.
  </em></dd>
</dl>
In this way we paint many slices from the 3D image simultaneously, not only 
the 2D slices displayed here. 
While we control the maximum size of the brush, it may shrink automatically, 
say, near geologic faults. 
Brush orientation and shape adapts automatically so that our painted 
subsurface model remains consistent with the 3D seismic image.
