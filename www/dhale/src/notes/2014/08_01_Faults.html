<h3>Image processing for faults</h3>
<p>August 1, 2014</p>
<p>
I am writing this note while travelling to Australia in the first leg of a <a
href="http://www.seg.org/education/lectures-courses/distinguished-lecturers/fall2014/hale-abstract">
worldwide lecture tour for the Society of Exploration Geophysicists</a>. I am
super excited to be doing this, for some obvious reasons, but also because
this tour gave me a perfect excuse for new research of seismic image
processing for geologic faults.

The 3D seismic image of the onshore Schoonebeek oil field in the Netherlands
was provided by Kees Rutten and Bob Howard, via <a
href="https://www.tno.nl/index.cfm?Taal=2">TNO, a Dutch research
organization</a>. It's a geologically beautiful high-resolution image, with
numerous intersecting faults. Displayed above are vertical slices of this 3D
seismic image, before and after unfaulting. The vertical white line represents
the intersection of orthogonal vertical slices through the 3D image.
</p><p>
The methods for locating faults and estimating fault slips are entirely
automatic, and consist mostly of some well-known image processing techniques
combined in ways that I describe in the SEG lecture.
</p><p>
Unfaulting here does not imply a reversal of geologic time, a restoration of
the subsurface to some original unfaulted state. Rather, unfaulting is merely
a simply way to assess the accuracy of the estimated fault locations and
slips. After unfaulting, subsurface reflectors should appear more continuous,
and this increased continuity is clearly apparent. But not everywhere, and
shortcomings are <em>opportunities</em> for future research.
</p><p>
One shortcoming is that the footwall side of every fault has been constrained
to not move during unfaulting. Where faults intersect, this constraint leads
to some kinky unfaulted seismic reflectors. These do not affect our visual
assessment of estimated fault slips, but how might we do better?
</p><p>
While thinking about that question, you can test this processing with your own
3D seismic images, because all of the <a
href="https://github.com/dhale/ipf">image processing software</a> used here is
freely available with an <a
href="https://github.com/dhale/ipf/blob/master/LICENSE.txt"> open-source
license</a>. That license enables companies to use this software in commercial
software products. Some have already done so, because an earlier version (now
about two years old) has been available with the same open-source license.
</p><p>
If you download the latest version, note that it includes software for
generating synthetic 3D images for testing. You can modify this software to
answer some good questions. For example, what slips are estimated at locations
where two conjugate faults intersect? (You can see such intersections in the
image slices displayed above.)
</p><p>
If you do build and run the software, I hope you will let me know. And if you
also attend the SEG lecture, please introduce yourself. I look forward to
meeting you.
