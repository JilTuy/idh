<h3>Tiny displacements in time-lapse seismic images</h3>
<p>January 24, 2007</p>
<p>
In time-lapse seismic imaging, we often observe displacements 
of features in images recorded at different times.
After accounting for changes in data acquisition, these displacements can be 
related to compaction of reservoir rocks as fluids are produced from them.
We call these displacements <em>apparent shifts</em> because they may be
more directly related to changes in seismic wave velocity outside the 
reservoir than to physical movements of reservoir boundaries.

Today, we typically measure only vertical apparent shifts, for two reasons.
First, the force of gravity leads us to expect vertical shifts to be 
larger than horizontal shifts.
Second, it is easier to measure shifts perpendicular to image features
than to measure shifts parallel to those features.
</p>
<p>
The second problem is illustrated in the figure below, which shows
2-D cross-correlations of local Gaussian windows of two seismic images.
The correlation peaks are well resolved vertically, but poorly resolved 
horizontally.
Because the locations of the peaks correspond to the apparent shifts we seek 
to estimate, horizontal components of those shifts are poorly resolved.

    Note the small vertical shifts of some correlation peaks.
    Horizontal shifts are more difficult to see.

We say "vertical" and "horizontal", when what we really mean is 
"perpendicular" and "parallel" to features in our images.
If those features were dipping at an angle of 45 degrees, then resolution
would be equally poor in both horizontal and vertical directions.
</p>
<p>
Ideally the peaks of our cross-correlations would be isotropic, with
roughly the same resolution in all directions, as in the figure below.
The processing used here is an example of adapting techniques from
general image processing to solve specific problems in seismic imaging.
Here we computed so-called <em>phase correlations</em>, and our adaptation 
is to do this in a seamless way for every sample in our images.

    Both vertical and horizontal components of shifts can be accurately
    estimated from the locations of peaks of these phase correlations.

<p>
Using phase correlations, we can reliably estimate both vertical and 
horizontal shifts in time-lapse seismic images with sub-pixel precision.
In one example, we have used phase correlations to observe horizontal
apparent shifts of about five meters in 3-D images sampled with twenty-five 
meter trace spacings; and these small sub-sample shifts are correlated with 
the geometry of the target reservoir.
</p>
<p>
Our problem now is to analyze these apparent shift vectors, to better
understand how they are related to changes within and above producing 
reservoirs.
