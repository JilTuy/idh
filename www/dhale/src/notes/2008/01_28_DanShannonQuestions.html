<h3>What's it like to be in geophysics?</h3>

Dan Shannon is a student-athlete at Grandview Heights High School in 
Columbus, Ohio. Dan recently asked me some thought-provoking questions:
<h4>
What do you want your students to get the most out of what you teach
 (concerning geophysics)?
</h4>
<p>
Most of our students enjoy thinking analytically; they think physics,
math, and computer science are fun. I want them to learn how to extend
and apply what they already enjoy to design and implement new
technology for geophysical exploration, which can be even more fun. In
other words, I want my students to develop skills that will enable
them to enjoy their work so much that it becomes play, something they
might do for only room and board; but they won't because their skills
are both rare and valuable.
</p>

<h4>
How do you believe the continued study of geophysics affects the world?
</h4>
<p>
Geophysics enables us to see and better understand the earth's
interior. Our ability to do this has many applications. Some
geophysicists explore for resources (oil, gas, water, minerals, ...),
unexploded ordinance, aging infrastructure in urban areas, ancient
civilizations, sites for nuclear waste and CO2 sequestration, and so
on. Other geophysicists look much deeper and try to understand
geologic processes and forces that cause earthquakes. Or they might
use seismic waves generated by earthquakes to better image the earth's
core and mantle. This list is far from complete. I should at least
mention other planets, and similarities between geophysical and
medical imaging. But these are some of the applications of geophysics
that have worldwide importance.
</p>

<h4>
What are the unique aspects of geophysical engineering?
</h4>
<p>
The applications described above are rather unique. And perhaps the
difference between science and engineering is less well-defined in
geophysics. But beyond that, geophysical engineering is much like
other engineering fields. For example, I used to think that
geophysicists have more opportunities to travel abroad, to see the
world. But I have learned by talking with Mines graduates in other
engineering fields that many have such opportunities today.
</p>

<h4>
How do the working conditions compare to other jobs; are they indoors,
 outdoors, both?
</h4>
<p>
Geophysicists work both indoors and/or outdoors. In my geophysical
career, I have worked outside covered in drilling mud and inside
programming some of the world's fastest supercomputers. Never at the
same time, of course, and more of the latter.
</p>

<h4>
What skills can/need to be integrated with geophysical engineering
 in order to be successful?
</h4>
<p>
In addition to geology and physics (clearly!), successful
geophysicists are likely to be skilled in mathematics, computer
science, and to a lesser extent chemistry. When I ask my colleagues
what subject they wish they had studied more while in school, most of
them say math, because that one seems to be most difficult to pick up
on the job while solving geophysical problems.
</p>

<h4>
How interpersonal is the study of geophysics?
</h4>
<p>
Probably no more or less so than any other scientific or engineering
discipline. But few geophysicists work alone, and many today work in
teams with other geoscientists and engineers.
</p>

<h4>
What opportunities does geophysical engineering offer, while in school,
that other areas of study do not offer?
</h4>
<p>
The opportunity to learn how mathematics, physics, computer science
and geology can all be woven together to do amazing things. Our
students tend to be those who enjoy putting these subjects together.
Opportunities to work both outdoors, acquiring geophysical data, and
indoors, developing and using computer software that analyzes those
data, may also be unusual. An example of this is our four-week summer
field session, which our students seem to especially enjoy, relative
to other students at Mines.
</p>

<h4>
What compels you to be involved in geophysics?
</h4>
<p>
I am more compelled to design and build computer programs, software
machines that can be wonderful combinations of art and engineering.
Geophysics just happens to provide some of the most challenging
computational problems and opportunities. With that interest in
computing and an education in physics, I more or less stumbled into
geophysics.
</p>

<h4>
What does an ordinary day of work involve?
</h4>
<p>
This varies quite a lot from day to day, but typically includes one or
more of the following activities: preparing and teaching classes,
working with students, working with colleagues, analytical work for
research, writing computer software, writing prose, responding to
email, and so on.
</p>

<h4>
What does an extraordinary day of work involve?
</h4>
<p>
A breakthrough in any of the activities listed above followed by a
workout with the Mines varsity swimming team with some favorite music
running in my brain. So what is a breakthrough? For me that could be
working with a student to find a simple and elegant solution to an
analytical or computational problem. Or perhaps it is when I am
stuck with a programming error while lecturing in a computer science
class, and everyone becomes very still (because this rarely happens),
and then a student finds the error before I do. Such days are
extraordinary.
