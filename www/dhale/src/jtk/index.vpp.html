<p>
The Mines Java Toolkit (JTK) is a set of Java packages and native (non-Java) 
code libraries for science and engineering. Applications
currently include digital signal processing and 2-D and 3-D graphics.
</p>
<p>
The Mines JTK is open-source software made available under the terms of the 
<a href="./license.html">Common Public License - v 1.0</a>.
</p>
<p>
You may browse 
<a href="http://boole.mines.edu/doc/api/index.html">documentation online</a>
for all Java packages, classes, and methods in the Mines JTK.
</p>
<p>
Source code is our most up-to-date and least ambiguous documentation, 
and you can browse our
<a href="http://boole.mines.edu/jtk/trunk">source code online</a>.
</p>
<p>
For more information on using and modifying the Mines JTK, please read our
<a href="http://boole.mines.edu/jtk/trunk/readme.txt">
build instructions (readme.txt)
</a> for the jtk project.
</p>

<h3>90% Pure Java</h3>
<p>
To take advantage of useful existing software not written in Java, we wrap 
such software using the Java Native Interface (JNI). Where needed, we load
JNI libraries dynamically via Java's System.loadLibrary method. Examples 
include our JNI libraries that wrap OpenGL (for 3-D graphics) and LAPACK 
(for dense linear algebra). 
</p>
<p>
To simplify development, we include pre-compiled binaries for our JNI 
libraries with the source code for the Mines JTK. Currently, we provide
JNI libraries for 32-bit x86 systems running Linux or Windows. For these
platforms, you need only a Java compiler to build the Mines JTK.
</p>
<p>
For other platforms, or to modify the JNI libraries used by the Mines JTK, 
please read our

<h3>Standard Tools</h3>
<p>
To build and use the Mines JTK, you need only the
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Java (SE)
  Development Kit</a>,
  which includes the Java compiler and runtime environment, and</li>
  <li><a href="http://ant.apache.org">Apache Ant</a>,
  which is like a portable <em>make</em> for Java programming, and a</li>
  <li><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion client</a>,
  which enables you to download (checkout) our source code onto your 
  computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These tools are widely used among Java software developers.
