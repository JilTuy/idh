<h3>

    Consider two multi-dimensional digital signals, each with S samples.
    For some number of lags L (L much less than S), the cost of computing 
    a single cross-correlation of these two signals is proportional to 
    S&times;L.
    By exploiting several properties of Gaussian windows, we can compute 
    S <em>local</em> cross-correlations, again with computational cost 
    proportional to S&times;L.
    Here, <em>local</em> means the cross-correlation of signals after 
    applying a Gaussian window centered on a single sample.
    Computational cost is independent of the size of the window.

    An efficient method for computing local auto-correlations leads to a new 
    method for local adaptive prediction or prediction error filtering of 
    multi-dimensional images. 
    Using a conjugate-gradient method for least-squares optimization, we 
    compute a different prediction filter for each sample in an image. 
    These adaptive prediction filters preserve locally coherent signals, 
    while attenuating random noise.

<h3>
  Recursive Gaussian filters
</h3>

    Gaussian or Gaussian derivative filtering is in several ways optimal
    for applications requiring low-pass filters or running averages.
    For short filters with lengths of a dozen samples or so, 
    direct convolution with a finite-length approximation to a Gaussian
    is the best implementation.
    However, for longer filters such as those used in computing running
    averages, recursive implementations may be much more efficient.
    Based on the filter length, we select one of two popular methods for 
    designing and implementing recursive Gaussian filters.

    We automatically generate meshes of subsurface velocity structures 
    from finely-sampled uniform velocity grids without providing external 
    additional constraints such as horizons and faults. 
    Unlike uniform grids, these new meshes provide a topological framework 
    that enables rapid editing of velocity models, while facilitating 
    numerical tasks such as seismic modeling and inversion.

<h3>Seismic interpretation with fluid flow simulation</h3>

    We construct simple reservoir models with a small number of flow units, 
    such as geologic layers and fault blocks.
    We call these units <em>tanks</em> and connect them with <em>tubes</em>.
    For such simple models, we may interactively adjust reservoir properties,
    such as porosities of tanks and transmissibilities of tubes, and then
    simulate fluid flow <em>during</em> seismic interpretation.
    Numerical experiments suggest that parameters we estimate for coarse
    tanks &amp; tubes models are meaningful; specifically, they may be used 
    to constrain more detailed models.

<h3>Seismic interpretation using global image segmentation</h3>

    A first step in seismic interpretation is seismic image segmentation.
    For most seismic images, with incompletely or poorly imaged faults and 
    horizons, global methods for segmentation are more robust than local 
    event tracking or region growing methods often used today.
    The disadvantage of global image segmentation methods has been their 
    relatively high computational cost.
    We reduce this cost by applying these methods to a space-filling mesh 
    aligned automatically with features in seismic images.
    The mesh makes global segmentation of 3-D seismic images feasible.

<h3>Atomic meshing of seismic images</h3>

    Today's work cycle from seismic imaging to reservoir simulation 
    requires a variety of data structures - simple arrays, triangulated 
    surfaces, non-manifold frameworks, corner-point grids, etc. - to 
    represent the earth's subsurface. 
    Conversions among these different representations are both time 
    consuming and error prone.
    Using simple image processing techniques, we automatically align a 
    lattice of points (atoms) with horizons and faults in a seismic image. 
    Connecting these points yields an unstructured space-filling polyhedral 
    (atomic) mesh. 
    This single data structure can integrate multiple tasks, such as seismic 
    interpretation, reservoir characterization, and flow simulation, thereby 
    reducing work cycle times and errors.

    Seismically imaged horizons and faults often correspond to 
    discontinuities in subsurface properties, such as permeability.
    We automatically align a lattice of points (atoms) either on or 
    alongside such features.
    3-D Delaunay triangulation of atoms aligned <em>on</em> image 
    features yields a tetrahedral mesh, with triangular faces of 
    tetrahedra coincident with subsurface discontinuities.
    Alternatively, the same triangulation of atoms aligned 
    <em>alongside</em> image features yields a dual Voronoi polyhedral 
    mesh in which polygonal faces coincide with subsurface discontinuities.
    Either mesh is suitable for fluid flow simulation.

<h3>Atomic images &mdash; a method for meshing digital images</h3>

    By combining a digital image with a lattice of points called 
    <em>atoms</em>, in which atom coordinates are computed to minimize 
    a potential energy function of the combination, we obtain a mesh 
    suitable for further computations.
    Each atom in the lattice contributes a potential function to an 
    atomic potential field. 
    The image represents another potential field. 
    Total potential energy of the lattice is a weighted sum of the 
    atomic and image potential fields, evaluated at atom coordinates. 
    Beginning with a pseudo-regular lattice, a generic optimization 
    algorithm moves atoms to minimize this total potential energy.
    After optimization, we connect the atoms to form a mesh that tends 
    to be aligned with image features.
