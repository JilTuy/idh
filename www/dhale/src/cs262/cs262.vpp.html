<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
An array of numbers is a simple and well-known <em>data structure</em>.
In this course, we use C++ to create and use other data structures, 
such as binary trees, linked lists, and hash tables, to solve problems 
in science and engineering.
</p>
<p>
Along the way, we learn fundamentals of 
<em>object-oriented programming</em>, including
<em>data abstraction</em> and <em>polymorphism</em>.
We also learn to exploit <em>generic programming</em>.
We learn to analyze <em>algorithmic complexity</em>,
so that we can decide which data structure or algorithm 
is best for a given problem.
</p>
<p>
We learn these subjects best by writing programs, 
so much of your time will be spent doing just that.
You will attend two one-hour lectures and one one-hour lab per week, 
and spend more time outside the classroom reading and programming in C++.
</p>

<h3>Section B</h3>
<p>
In Spring, 2006, MACS 262 is taught in two sections A and B.
Example programs for section B can be found on isengard in
<code>/class/cs262b/common/examples/</code>.
</p>

<h3>Time and place</h3>
<p>
Mondays and Wednesdays (lectures) and Fridays (labs): 9:00-9:50, CTLM 229
</p>

<h3>Text</h3>
<p>
  <cite>Data Structures and Other Objects Using C++</cite>,
  by Main and Savitch.
  Available at the CSM bookstore.
</p>

<h3>Course web pages</h3>
<p>
For most information on this course, including lab assignments, 
tentative schedule, tutorials and other handouts, go to the
<a href="http://www.mines.edu/Academic/courses/math_cs/macs262/">
course web pages</a>.
Those were developed by 
<a href="http://www.mines.edu/~crader">Dr. Cyndi Rader</a>,
the instructor for section A of MACS 262. (You are in section B.)
</p>
<p>
Some consistency with section A will be maintained throughout the course, 
because you are expected to learn the same material (and will take the same
final exam), regardless of the section for which you have registered.
However, during the semester, you should routinely check back
<a href="cs262.html">here</a>,
where any material specific to section B will be highlighted above.
</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>
Your grade is based on
</p>
<ul>
  <li>45%: labs and other homework</li>
  <li>30%: midterm exams (two)</li>
  <li>25%: final exam</li>
</ul>

<h3>Late work</h3>
<p>
Most labs require skills learned in previous labs.
So try not to fall behind.
Programming takes time, and you will find it difficult to catch up.
However, because there may be occasions when you are unable to complete
a lab assignment on time, and because it is better for you to 
learn the material and complete a lab late than not at all, you may
submit late work for grading.
The penalty for late labs is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 day late (e.g., by midnight Tuesday for a lab due Monday), -1 point</li>
  <li>2 days late, -2 points</li>
  <li>3 days late, -4 points</li>
  <li>4 days late, -6 points</li>
</ul>
<p>
Labs submitted more than 4 days late will not accepted except by 
prior arrangement with the instructor.
</p>
<p>
If you have not completed a lab assignment, then you should submit 
whatever work you have completed for partial credit.
If you submit work more than once, then only your last submission 
will be graded.
You do not need permission to submit an assignment late.
Late points will simply be deducted for all late assignments. 
For example, you need not explain that you were really ill;
simply complete and submit the lab as soon as possible.
</p>

<h3>Working with others</h3>
<p>
The following policy applies to all Computer Science courses at Mines:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  If the project is an individual effort, you are not allowed to give code 
  you have developed to another student or use code provided by another 
  student.  If the project is a group effort, you are allowed to share 
  code only with members of your group. 
  </li>
  <li>
  You are encouraged to discuss programming projects with other students in 
  the class, provided that:
  <ol>
    <li>
    You view another student's code only for the purpose of offering 
    debugging assistance.  
    Other students give advice only on what problems to look for; 
    they do not debug your code for you. <em>You</em> make all 
    changes to <em>your</em> code.
    </li>
    <li>
    You follow the empty hands rule, which means that you leave the discussion 
    without any (electronic, mechanical or other) record of it.
    </li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
  Any materials from outside sources, such as books, projects, and,
  especially, the Web, should be properly referenced and should be used 
  only if specifically allowed for the assignment.
  </li>
  <li>
  If you are aware of students violating this policy, you are encouraged to 
  inform the course instructor.
  Violations of this policy will be treated as academic misconduct by all 
  students involved.
  See the Undergraduate Bulletin for a description of the Student Honor Code.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
<em>
For MACS 262, assume that all projects are individual efforts, 
unless explicitly stated otherwise.
Furthermore, material from the Web is not acceptable for this course.
</em>
